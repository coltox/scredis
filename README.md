# scredis

Scredis is a reactive, non-blocking and ultra-fast Scala [Redis](http://redis.io) client built on top of Akka IO. 
It has been (and still is) extensively used in production at Livestream.

* [Documentation](https://github.com/scredis/scredis/wiki)
* [Scaladoc](http://scredis.github.io/scredis/latest/api/scredis/)

## Features
* Supports all Redis commands up to v3.0.0
* Built on top of Akka non-blocking IO
* Super fast, see [Benchmarks](#benchmarks) section below
* Automatic reconnection
* Automatic pipelining
* Transactions
* Pub/Sub
  * Subscribe selectively with partial functions
  * Tracked Subscribe and Unsubscribe commands (they return a Future as any other commands)
  * Automatically resubscribes to previously subscribed channels/patterns upon reconnection
* Cluster support via `RedisCluster`
* Customizable serialization and deserialization of command inputs and outputs
* Fully configurable
  * Akka dispatchers
  * Pipelined write batch size
  * Receive timeout
  * TCP buffer size hints
  * Request encoding buffer pool
  * Concurrent requests cap (bounded memory consumption)

## Getting started

### Binaries

Scredis 2.2.5+ is compatible with Scala 2.11, 2.12 and 2.13.
Binary releases are hosted on the Sonatype Central Repository.

```scala
libraryDependencies += "com.github.scredis" %% "scredis" % "2.3.1"
```

Snapshots / development versions are hosted on a separate bintray repository.

```scala
resolvers += Resolver.bintrayRepo("scredis","maven")

libraryDependencies += "com.github.scredis" %% "scredis" % "<version>"
```

### Quick example
```scala
import scredis._
import scala.util.{ Success, Failure }

// Creates a Redis instance with default configuration.
// See reference.conf for the complete list of configurable parameters.
val redis = Redis()

// Import internal ActorSystem's dispatcher (execution context) to register callbacks
import redis.dispatcher

// Executing a non-blocking command and registering callbacks on the returned Future
redis.hGetAll("my-hash") onComplete {
  case Success(content) => println(content)
  case Failure(e) => e.printStackTrace()
}

// Executes a blocking command using the internal, lazily initialized BlockingClient
redis.blocking.blPop(0, "queue")

// Shutdown all initialized internal clients along with the ActorSystem
redis.quit()
```

```scala
import scredis.PubSubMessage
private val subscriptionHandler: Function[PubSubMessage, Unit] = {
  case m: PubSubMessage.Subscribe => println(s"Subscribed to channel ${m.channel}")
  case m: PubSubMessage.Message => println(s"Received message for channel ${m.channel} with data ${m.readAs[String]()}")
  case m: PubSubMessage.Unsubscribe => println(s"Unsubscribed from channel ${m.channelOpt}")
  case m: PubSubMessage.PSubscribe => println(s"Subscribed to channels matching pattern ${m.pattern}")
  case m: PubSubMessage.PMessage => println(s"Received message for pattern ${m.pattern} on channel ${m.channel} with data ${m.readAs[String]()}")
  case m: PubSubMessage.PUnsubscribe => println(s"Unsubscribed from pattern matching ${m.patternOpt}")
  case e: PubSubMessage.Error => println(s"Scredis received error $e")
}

// Creates a Redis instance with default configuration.
// Provide custom function handling pub/sub related events
val redis = scredis.Redis(subscription = subscriptionHandler)

// Subscribes to a Pub/Sub channel using the internal, lazily initialized SubscriberClient
redis.subscriber.subscribe("My Channel")

// Later unsubscribe from channel
redis.subscriber.unsubscribe("My Channel")

// Shutdown all initialized internal clients along with the ActorSystem
redis.quit()
```

## Benchmarks

The following benchmarks have been performed using [ScalaMeter](http://scalameter.github.io/) with the 
`SeparateJvmsExecutor`, configured with `Warmer.Default`, `Measurer.Default` and `Aggregator.average`.
The source code can be found [here](https://github.com/scredis/scredis/blob/master/src/test/scala/scredis/ClientBenchmark.scala).

### Hardware
* MacBook Pro (15-inch, Early 2011)
* 2.0GHz quad-core Intel Core i7 processor with 6MB shared L3 cache
* 16GB of 1333MHz DDR3 memory
* Mac OS X 10.9.4

### Java
```
> java -version
java version "1.7.0_45"
Java(TM) SE Runtime Environment (build 1.7.0_45-b18)
Java HotSpot(TM) 64-Bit Server VM (build 24.45-b08, mixed mode)
```

### Scala
Scala 2.11.2

### Scredis
2.0.0-RC1 with default configuration

### Redis
Redis 2.8.13 running locally (on the same machine)

## Developing

### Running the tests

The tests require two Redis instances to be running with some specific configuration options set.
They can be started with the `start-redis-test-instances.sh` script. Stopping is done with script `stop-redis.sh`

Some tests require redis-cluster, redis-cluster can be started with `run-redis-cluster.sh`.
6 redis instances will be started on ports 7000-7005 without authorization.

## Releasing
Scredis uses [sbt-dynver](https://github.com/dwijnand/sbt-dynver) plugin to automatically manage versioning.

Releases are only performed from a master branch.

If current commit on master branch is not tagged then a previous tag is used as base version with added current date (snapshot version).

If current commit on master is tagged then a version is the same as tag and this version is stable.

Build on travis checks what is current branch and if it is master it executes publish step.

Publish step uses sbt plugin [sbt-bintray](https://github.com/sbt/sbt-bintray) to publish artifacts to bintray repository.

Bintray repository [https://bintray.com/scredis/maven/scredis](https://bintray.com/scredis/maven/scredis).

Released version is automatically populated to jcenter bintray [https://search.maven.org/search?q=g:com.github.scredis](https://search.maven.org/search?q=g:com.github.scredis)

Manual step is needed to populate to [mvnrepository](https://mvnrepository.com/artifact/com.github.scredis/scredis)

Maintainer performing stable release should:
* switch to master branch and update README with tag `X.Y.Z`
* commit changes `git add README.md && git commit -m "Release version vX.Y.Z`
* `git tag -a "vX.Y.Z" -m "Release version vX.Y.Z"` # tag current commit with given tag
* execute `./gen-doc.sh` and `git commit --amend --no-edit` to append changes to last commit
* `git push origin vX.Y.Z` # tags are not automatically pushed by `git push`
* go to [bintray](https://bintray.com/scredis/maven/scredis#central) and click 'Sync' to push released version to mvnrepository.
